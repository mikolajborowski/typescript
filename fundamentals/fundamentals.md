# Typescript - fundamentals
This file was created for me to have quick access to all basic knowledge and notes that I have taken when i attended online typescript tutorial. Looking for real apps where I used typescript? Check out my [Vue 2](https://github.com/mikolajborowski/vue2) or [Vue 3](https://github.com/mikolajborowski/vue3) projects.

# What is typescript?

TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
